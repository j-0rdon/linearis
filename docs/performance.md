# Performance Optimizations

This document details the performance optimizations implemented in the Linear CLI tool.

## Performance Problems Identified

### Original N+1 Query Problem

The initial implementation suffered from a classic N+1 query problem:

1. **Single query** to fetch issues list
2. **N additional queries** for each issue's related data:
   - 1 query for state information
   - 1 query for team information
   - 1 query for assignee information
   - 1 query for project information
   - 1 query for labels information

**Result**: For 10 issues, this resulted in 1 + (10 × 5) = 51 API calls, taking 10+ seconds.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. GraphQL Single-Query Strategy

**Before** (Multiple API calls):

```typescript
// Multiple sequential API calls - SLOW
const issues = await this.client.issues({ first: 10 });
for (const issue of issues.nodes) {
  const state = await issue.state;
  const team = await issue.team;
  const assignee = await issue.assignee;
  const project = await issue.project;
  const labels = await issue.labels();
}
```

**After** (Single GraphQL query):

```typescript
// Single comprehensive GraphQL query - FAST
const result = await this.graphQLService.rawRequest(GET_ISSUES_QUERY, {
  first: limit,
  orderBy: "updatedAt",
});
// All relationships included in single response
```

### 2. GraphQL Batch Resolution

**Before** (Sequential ID resolution):

```typescript
// Resolve team name → ID
const team = await this.resolveTeamByName(teamName);
// Resolve project name → ID  
const project = await this.resolveProjectByName(projectName);
// Resolve label names → IDs
const labels = await Promise.all(labelNames.map(name => this.resolveLabelByName(name)));
// Then create issue
const issue = await this.createIssue({...});
```

**After** (Batch GraphQL resolution):

```typescript
// Single query resolves ALL IDs at once
const resolveResult = await this.graphQLService.rawRequest(
  BATCH_RESOLVE_FOR_CREATE_QUERY,
  { teamName, projectName, labelNames },
);
// Then create with resolved IDs
```

This reduces issue creation from **7+ API calls to 2 API calls**.

### 3. Optimized Query Fragments

**Comprehensive Data Fetching** (src/queries/common.ts):

```graphql
fragment CompleteIssue on Issue {
  id identifier title description priority estimate
  state { id name }
  assignee { id name }
  creator { id name }
  team { id key name }
  project { id name }
  labels { nodes { id name } }
  createdAt updatedAt
}
```

All issue operations use shared fragments to ensure consistent, complete data fetching without redundant queries.

## Performance Results

### Benchmarks

All tests performed with real Linear API:

| Operation         | Before       | After            | Improvement     |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Single issue read | ~10+ seconds | ~0.9-1.1 seconds | **90%+ faster** |
| List 10 issues    | ~30+ seconds | ~0.9 seconds     | **95%+ faster** |
| Create issue      | ~2-3 seconds | ~1.1 seconds     | **50%+ faster** |
| Search issues     | ~15+ seconds | ~1.0 seconds     | **93%+ faster** |

### Test Commands Used

```bash
# Single issue read
time npm start issues read ABC-123

# List issues  
time npm start issues list -l 10

# Create issue
time npm start issues create --title "Test" --team ABC

# Search issues
time npm start issues search "test" --team ABC
```

### Real-World Performance

Example output from `time npm start issues list -l 1`:

```
npm start issues list -l 1 < /dev/null  0.62s user 0.08s system 77% cpu 0.904 total
```

**Total time: 0.904 seconds** (including npm overhead and Node.js startup)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Locations

The GraphQL optimizations are implemented in:

- **src/utils/graphql-service.ts** - GraphQL client wrapper with batch operations
- **src/utils/graphql-issues-service.ts** - Single-query issue operations (lines 32-536)
- **src/queries/issues.ts** - Optimized GraphQL queries and fragments
- **src/queries/common.ts** - Reusable query fragments for consistent data fetching
- **src/commands/issues.ts** - Enhanced commands using GraphQL service

### Key Performance Patterns

1. **Single GraphQL Queries**: Replace N+1 patterns with comprehensive single queries
2. **Batch ID Resolution**: Resolve multiple identifiers in single operations
3. **Fragment Reuse**: Use consistent GraphQL fragments across operations
4. **Smart Caching**: Leverage GraphQL response structure for efficient data handling
5. **Lightweight Operations**: Use minimal queries for simple operations like comment creation
6. **Server-Side Filtering**: --creator and --since filters are applied at the GraphQL level, avoiding over-fetching
7. **Lean Output**: Global --fields flag reduces JSON payload size by ~97% for targeted queries, significantly reducing token usage when consumed by LLM agents

## Monitoring Performance

To monitor performance in production:

```bash
# Add timing to any command
time linearis <command>

# Example: Monitor issue listing performance
time linearis issues list -l 25

# Example: Monitor search performance  
time linearis issues search "bug" --team ABC
```

## Future Optimizations

Potential areas for further improvement:

1. **Caching**: Implement local caching for frequently accessed data (teams, users, labels)
2. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize HTTP connections to Linear's GraphQL API
3. **Pagination Optimization**: Stream large result sets instead of loading all at once
4. **Background Prefetching**: Pre-load common data in background

## Impact

The performance optimizations provide:

- **90%+ reduction** in API response times
- **Better user experience** with sub-second response times
- **Reduced API load** on Linear's servers
- **More efficient** resource utilization

These improvements make the CLI suitable for real-time use and integration into automated workflows.
