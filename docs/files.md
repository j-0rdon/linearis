# Files Catalog

Linearis project follows a clean, modular structure with TypeScript source files organized by function. The codebase separates concerns into command handlers, optimized GraphQL service layers, and type definitions, making it easy to locate functionality and understand system relationships.

All source files use modern ES modules with TypeScript for type safety. The project maintains clear boundaries between CLI interface logic, GraphQL operations, SDK fallback operations, and data access patterns. Configuration and documentation files provide comprehensive project context and development guidance.

## Core Source Files

### Main Application Logic

**src/main.ts** - CLI entry point and program setup with Commander.js framework **src/commands/issues.ts** - Complete issue management commands (list, search, create, read, update) with enhanced label and parent relationship management **src/commands/projects.ts** - Project operations commands (list, read) with simplified interface **src/commands/comments.ts** - Comment operations (create) with lightweight issue ID resolution **src/commands/teams.ts** - Team operations (list) with workspace team discovery **src/commands/users.ts** - User operations (list) with active user filtering **src/commands/embeds.ts** - File download command for Linear uploaded files with signed URL support

### Service Layer

**src/utils/graphql-service.ts** - GraphQL client wrapper with raw query execution and batch operation support **src/utils/graphql-issues-service.ts**

- Optimized GraphQL operations for issues with single-query strategy and batch ID resolution **src/utils/linear-service.ts** - Legacy SDK-based Linear API integration with smart ID resolution and fallback operations **src/utils/auth.ts** - Multi-source authentication handling (API token flag, environment variable, token file) **src/utils/output.ts** - JSON response formatting, global --fields filtering, and standardized error handling with async command wrapping **src/utils/date-parser.ts** - Relative date parsing for --since filtering (e.g. 3d, 1w, 2m, 1y → ISO 8601 date) **src/utils/embed-parser.ts** - Markdown parsing for Linear upload URL extraction with embed info and expiration tracking **src/utils/file-service.ts** - Authenticated file download service with signed URL support and smart authentication detection

### Type System

**src/utils/linear-types.d.ts** - Complete TypeScript interfaces for Linear entities (LinearIssue, LinearProject) and operation parameters (CreateIssueArgs, UpdateIssueArgs, SearchIssuesArgs). LinearIssue includes creator field. SearchIssuesArgs includes creatorId and since fields. **src/utils/uuid.ts** - UUID validation utilities for smart ID resolution

### Query Definitions

**src/queries/common.ts** - Reusable GraphQL fragments for consistent data fetching across operations **src/queries/issues.ts** - Optimized GraphQL queries and mutations for issue operations (get, create, update, search) **src/queries/index.ts** - Query exports and organization

## Configuration Files

### Package Management

**package.json** - Project configuration with dependencies (@linear/sdk, commander, tsx), scripts, and Node.js >= 22.0.0 requirement **package-lock.json** - Dependency lock file ensuring reproducible builds with exact versions **mise.toml** - Development environment configuration with Node.js 22 and Deno 2.2.8 tool versions

### Documentation and Specifications

**README.md** - User-facing documentation with installation instructions, usage examples, and performance benchmarks **CLAUDE.md** - AI-specific project instructions, architecture overview, and development guidelines for LLM agents **PERFORMANCE.md** - Detailed performance optimization analysis with before/after benchmarks and optimization techniques

## Platform Implementation

### Command Interface Layer

**src/main.ts (lines 3-25)** - Sets up Commander.js with global options and subcommand registration

- Global `--api-token` option handling
- Global `--fields` option for lean JSON output with dot notation support
- Default help action when no subcommand provided
- Modular command setup via imported functions
- preAction hook to apply global --fields filter before command execution

**src/commands/*.ts** - Command-specific implementations with consistent patterns:

- Parameter validation and smart ID resolution
- Service layer integration via createLinearService
- Standardized error handling and JSON output

### GraphQL Service Layer

**src/utils/graphql-issues-service.ts** - Optimized GraphQL issue operations:

- Lines 32-46: Single-query issue listing (reduces N+1 queries to 1 query)
- Lines 52-100: Issue retrieval by ID with comprehensive data fetching
- Lines 109-245: Enhanced issue updates with batch resolution and label modes
- Lines 253-390: Optimized issue creation with batch ID resolution
- Lines 398-536: Advanced search with filtering and GraphQL optimization

**src/utils/graphql-service.ts** - GraphQL client wrapper:

- Lines 8-32: Raw GraphQL query execution with error handling
- Lines 37-44: Batch query operations for parallel execution

### Legacy API Integration Layer

**src/utils/linear-service.ts** - SDK-based Linear API service (fallback operations):

- Lines 193-290: Smart issue ID resolution supporting both UUIDs and human-readable identifiers
- Lines 354-393: Project operations with relationship fetching
- Lines 398-473: Smart ID resolution methods for projects, labels, and teams

**docs/Linear-API@current.graphql** - Linear GraphQL API schema, downloaded from https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/sdl?selectedSchema=%23%40%21api%21%40%23

## Build System

### Execution Environment

**Development Execution** - TypeScript execution via tsx:

- tsx handles TypeScript compilation at runtime for development
- ES modules support via package.json "type": "module"
- All imports use .js extensions for ES module compatibility

**Production Build** - Compiled JavaScript execution:

- `npm run build` creates executable dist/main.js (chmod +x automatically applied)
- Significantly faster execution than tsx for production use
- Clean build process removes previous dist/ directory

**Development Scripts** - package.json scripts section:

- `npm start` executes tsx src/main.ts for development
- `npm run build` compiles to executable dist/main.js
- `npm run clean` removes compiled dist/ directory
- `npm test` runs the test suite

### Dependencies Structure

**Production Dependencies** (package.json lines 18-22):

- @linear/sdk ^58.1.0 - Official Linear GraphQL API client (used for GraphQL client and fallback operations)
- commander ^14.0.0 - CLI framework for command structure

**Development Dependencies** (package.json lines 23-26):

- @types/node ^22.0.0 - Node.js type definitions
- tsx ^4.20.5 - TypeScript execution engine for development
- typescript ^5.0.0 - TypeScript compiler and language support

### File Relationships and Dependencies

**Modern Command Flow**: src/main.ts → src/commands/*.ts → src/utils/graphql-issues-service.ts → src/utils/graphql-service.ts → @linear/sdk GraphQL client

**Legacy Command Flow**: src/main.ts → src/commands/*.ts → src/utils/linear-service.ts → @linear/sdk

**Embeds Command Flow**: src/main.ts → src/commands/embeds.ts → src/utils/file-service.ts → Linear uploads.linear.app

**Embed Extraction Flow**: GraphQL response → src/utils/graphql-issues-service.ts → src/utils/embed-parser.ts → embeds array in JSON output

**Authentication Flow**: Command options → src/utils/auth.ts → service layer

**Response Flow**: GraphQL/Service results → src/utils/output.ts (with optional --fields filtering) → JSON console output

**Date Parsing Flow**: --since flag → src/utils/date-parser.ts → ISO 8601 date → GraphQL createdAt filter

**Query Organization**: src/queries/issues.ts → src/queries/common.ts fragments → GraphQL execution

### Key Entry Points for Development

**Adding Commands** - Start with src/commands/ files, follow existing patterns\
**GraphQL Integration** - Add queries to src/queries/ and extend src/utils/graphql-issues-service.ts\
**Legacy API Integration** - Extend src/utils/linear-service.ts methods for fallback operations\
**Authentication** - Modify src/utils/auth.ts for new authentication methods\
**Type Definitions** - Update src/utils/linear-types.d.ts for new data structures

### File Size and Complexity

Most files are focused and maintainable:

- src/main.ts: 25 lines - Minimal CLI setup
- src/utils/auth.ts: 39 lines - Simple authentication logic
- src/utils/output.ts: 34 lines - Utility functions only
- src/commands/embeds.ts: 58 lines - File download command
- src/utils/graphql-service.ts: 62 lines - GraphQL client wrapper
- src/utils/embed-parser.ts: 86 lines - Markdown embed extraction
- src/utils/file-service.ts: 111 lines - File download with auth
- src/commands/issues.ts: 211 lines - Comprehensive but focused
- src/commands/comments.ts: 46 lines - Simple comment operations
- src/queries/issues.ts: 301 lines - GraphQL queries and mutations
- src/utils/graphql-issues-service.ts: 604 lines - Optimized GraphQL operations
- src/utils/linear-service.ts: 485 lines - Legacy SDK operations (could be reduced as GraphQL operations replace them)

### Naming Conventions

**Files**: Kebab-case for multi-word names (linear-service.ts, graphql-issues-service.ts, linear-types.d.ts)\
**Directories**: Lowercase single words (commands, utils, queries)\
**Exports**: PascalCase classes (LinearService, GraphQLIssuesService), camelCase functions (createLinearService, createGraphQLService)
